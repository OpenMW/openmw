	\page configurations Configurations

	A common task in shader development is to provide a different set of simpler shaders for all your materials. Some examples:
	 - When rendering cubic or planar reflection maps in real-time, you will want to disable shadows.
	 - For an in-game minimap render target, you don't want to have fog.

	For this task, the library provides a \a Configuration concept.

	A Configuration is a set of properties that can override global settings, as long as this Configuration is active.

	Here's an example. Say you have a global setting with the name 'shadows' that controls if your materials receive shadows.

	Now, lets create a configuration for our reflection render targets that disables shadows for all materials. Paste the following in a new file with the extension '.configuration':

	\code
	configuration reflection_targets
	{
		shadows false
	}
	\endcode

	\note You may also create configurations using sh::Factory::createConfiguration.

	The active Configuration is controlled by the active material scheme in Ogre. So, in order to use the configuration "reflection_targets" for your reflection renders, simply call
	\code
	viewport->setMaterialScheme ("reflection_targets");
	\endcode
	on the Ogre viewport of your reflection render!
