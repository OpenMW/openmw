    Default: off
    Use the traditional point light attenuation formula which lacks an early fade out.

    A flaw of the traditional formula is that light influence never quite reaches zero.
    This is physically accurate, but can cause lighting seams because lights do not affect the entire scene.
    Early fade out helps diminish these seams at the cost of darkening the scene.

    Morrowind uses the traditional formula, so you may want to enable this if you dislike the brightness differences.
    Alternatively, try changing the minimum interior brightness.

ForcePerPixelLighting: "Per-Pixel Lighting"
ForcePerPixelLightingTooltip: |-
    Force the use of per-pixel lighting. By default, only bump- and normal-mapped objects use per-pixel lighting.

    Only affects objects drawn with shaders.

    Enabling per-pixel lighting results in visual differences to the original MW engine as certain lights in Morrowind rely on vertex lighting to look as intended.

    Note that groundcover shaders and particle effects ignore this setting.

    \"Legacy\" always uses 8 lights per object. It provides results most similar to Morrowind's lighting.\n\n
    \"Shaders (compatibility)\" removes the 8 light limit. This mode also enables lighting on groundcover. It is recommended to use this with older hardware and a light limit closer to 8.\n\n
    \"Shaders\" carries all of the benefits that \"Shaders (compatibility)\" does, but uses a modern approach that allows for a higher max lights count with little to no performance penalties on modern hardware."

MatchSunlightToSun: "Match Sunlight to Sun"
MatchSunlightToSunTooltip: |-
    In Morrowind, the apparent sun position does not match its light direction due to mysterious reasons.
    We preserve this unrealistic behavior for compatibility.

    This option makes the sun light source's position match the sun's position.
