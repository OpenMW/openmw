# This is the default OpenMW animation blending config file (global config) , will affect NPCs and creatures but not animated objects.
# If you want to provide an animation blending config for your modded animations - DO NOT override the global config in your mod.
# For details on how to edit and create your own blending rules, see https://openmw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/modding/animation-blending.html

blending_rules:
  # General blending rule, any transition that will not be caught by the rules below - will use this rule
  - from: "*"
    to: "*"
    easing: "sineOut"
    duration: 0.25
  # From anything to sneaking
  - from: "*"

  - from: "*"
    to: "sneakforward*"
    easing: "springOutWeak"
    duration: 0.4
  # From any to preparing for an attack swing (e.g "weapononehanded: chop start").
  # Note that Rules like *:chop* will technically match any weapon attack animation with
  # an animation key beginning on "chop". This includes attack preparation, attack itself and follow-through.
  # Yet since rules below this block take care of more specific transitions - most likely this block will
  # only affect "any animation"->"attack swing preparation".
