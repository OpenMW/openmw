This directory contains the 15 layers exported from the SVG in scalable/,
as well as a BASH+imagemagick script to composite them into the final 32 icons.

If you edit the SVG (Inkscape is strongly recommended for editing it), export
the layers into raster overwriting these files and run the script to assemble
the final icons.

Enjoy my icons!
