Foreword

OpenMW is a complete game engine built to be content agnostic. 
The majority of this guide is applicable to any non-Morrowind project using its engine. 
That being said, it was designed with the extensive modding community of Morrowind in mind. 
Therefore, if you are already familiar with modding in Morrowind, 
you will likely be able to start modding in OpenMW with little to no instruction. 
We do recommend you at least refer to :doc:`differences` to find out about what's different between OpenMW and the 
original Morrowind engine. For everyone else, or just a good refresher, read on!
