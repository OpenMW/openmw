scaling factor
--------------

:Type:		floating point

A value of 1.0 results in the normal scale. Larger values are useful to increase the scale of the GUI for high resolution displays.
This setting can only be configured by editing the settings configuration file.

font size
---------

:Type:		integer
:Range:		12 to 20
:Default:	16

Allows to specify glyph size for in-game fonts.

--------------

:Type:		integer
:Range:		48 to 960
