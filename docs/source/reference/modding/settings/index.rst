Advanced Settings Configuration
###############################

This part of the guide will cover how to make modifications to the more arcane settings in OpenMW,
most of which are not available from in-game menus, to optimize or customize your OpenMW experience.
If you are familiar with ``.ini`` tweaks in Morrowind or the other games, this will be quite similar.
All settings described in this section are changed in ``settings.cfg``, located in your OpenMW user directory.
See :doc:`../paths` for this location.

Changing Settings
#################

#.	Once you have located your ``settings.cfg`` file, open it in a plain text editor.
#.	Find the setting(s) you wish to change in the following pages.
#.	If the setting is not already in ``settings.cfg``,
	add it by copy and pasting the name exactly as written in this guide.
#.	Set the value of the setting by typing ``= <value>`` after the setting on the same line,
	using an appropriate value in place of ``<value>``.
#.	If this is the first setting from it's category that you're adding,
	be sure to add the heading in square brackets ``[]`` above it using just the setting type,
	i.e. without the word "Settings".

	For example, to delay tooltips popping up by 1 second, add the line ``tooltip delay = 1.0``.
	Then to the line above, type ``[GUI]``, as the tooltip delay setting comes from the "GUI Settings" section.

Although this guide attempts to be comprehensive and up to date,
you will always be able to find the full list of settings available and their default values in ``settings-default.cfg``
in your main OpenMW installation directory.
The ranges included with each setting are the physically possible ranges, not recommendations.

.. warning::
	As the title suggests, these are advanced settings.
	If digging around plain text files and manually editing settings sounds scary to you,
	you may want to steer clear of altering these files. That being said,
	this guide should be plenty clear enough that you can find the setting you want to change and safely edit it.
