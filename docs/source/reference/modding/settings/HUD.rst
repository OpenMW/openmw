crosshair
---------

:Type:		boolean
:Range:		True/False
:Default:	True

This setting determines whether the crosshair or reticle is displayed. 
Enabling the crosshair provides more immediate feedback about which object is currently the focus of actions.
Some players perceive that disabling the crosshair provides a more immersive experience.
Another common use is to disable the crosshair for screen shots.

As an alternative to this setting, the complete GUI, including the crosshair, may be toggled at runtime with the F11 key.

This setting can be toggled with the Crosshair button in the Prefs panel of the Options menu.
