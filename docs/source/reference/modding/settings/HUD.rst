crosshair
---------

:Type:		boolean
:Range:		True/False
:Default:	True

This setting determines whether the crosshair or reticle is displayed. Some players perceive that disabling the crosshair provides a more immersive experience. Another common use is to disable the crosshair for screen shots. Enabling the crosshair provides more immediate feedback about which object is currently the focus of actions.

The default value is true. This setting can be toggled with the Crosshair button in the Prefs panel of the Options menu.
