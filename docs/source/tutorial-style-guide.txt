Foreword
--------

I shall try to be as brief as possible without sacrificing clarity, just as you should be when writing documentation.
The SCOPE of this guide is limited to all non-source code documentation.

Language
--------

British English
Sorry, I'm American and I'll probably have a million relapses,
but this seems to have been decided and uniformity is key!

Text Wrapping
-------------

After discussing the various benefits of manual and automatic linefeeds,
we've come to the conclusion that we should use semantic linefeeds with a hard max at 120 characters.
Basically this boils down manually inserting a line break where it makes sense within the phrasing.
I prefer to keep it at commas and periods because those are universal places people pause,
even while reading in their head.
It may look a little funny in plain text, but it is readable,
and none of this makes a difference in the final documentation.

The reason this makes the most sense is GitHub won't text wrap automatically in RST documents,
and it also compares files based on lines.
This means you're less likely to run into conflicts and simply makes it easier to view changes.

Indentations
------------

This isn't as important, especially since Sphinx converts tabs to spaces,
but I find it much easier to keep large blocks of things aligned if you just tab.
If you can edit your tab width, please set it to 4 spaces.

Spaces
------

Use only one space after each sentence. Some people were taught two spaces, but this is a carry-over from typewriters.
Even though your text editor is probably using monospaced characters like a typewriter,
the formats Sphinx is converting into will make all the adjustments they need to be beautifully legible.

Commas
------

Oxford comma. Use it. I know this goes against using British English, but this is technical writing.
You cannot assume our audience will know from context if the last two items in a list are grouped or not.
I also prefer parentheticals to commas around gerund phrases.

Files and Extensions
--------------------

When referring to a filename or filepath use the double back quotes as for inline literals. (e.g. ``morrowind.exe``)
When referring to a file extension by itself, use ``.lowerCaseExtension``. (e.g. ``.esm``)

If referring to a folder or file by a general name, use *emphasis*
If referring to a folder by its actual name, even without the path, use ``inline literal``
