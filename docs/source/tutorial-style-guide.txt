Foreword
--------

I shall try to be as brief as possible without sacrificing clarity, just as you should be when writing documentation. The SCOPE of this guide is limited to all non-source code documentation.

Language
--------

British English
Sorry, I'm American and I'll probably have a million relapses, but this seems to have been decided and uniformity is key!

Text Wrapping
-------------

DO NOT manually decide where each line ends! Enable text wrapping in your text editor! (usually under View) Even Notepad allows automatic text wrapping, so use it. If you program, you may be used to keeping your lines under 80 characters wide and manually pressing enter, but don't. This is because we are writing mostly prose. When someone has to come in and edit portions of text that puts all this out of alignment, it takes FOREVER to readjust everything. Plus, indentation is very important in ReST, and you may forget to indent properly.

Indentations
------------

This isn't as important, especially since Sphinx converts tabs to spaces, but I find it much easier to keep large blocks of things aligned if you just tab. If you can edit your tab width, please set it to 4 spaces.

Spaces
------

Use only one space after each sentence. Some people were taught two spaces, but this is a carry-over from typewriters. Even though your text editor is probably using monospaced characters like a typewriter, the formats Sphinx is converting into will make all the adjustments they need to be beautifully legible.

Commas
------

Oxford comma. Use it. I know this goes against using British English, but this is technical writing. You cannot assume our audience will know from context if the last two items in a list are grouped or not.
I also prefer parentheticals to commas around gerund phrases.

Files and Extensions
--------------------

When referring to a filename or filepath use the double back quotes as for inline literals. (e.g. ``morrowind.exe``)
When referring to a file extension by itself, use ``.lowerCaseExtension``. (e.g. ``.esm``)

If referring to a folder or file by a general name, use *emphasis*
If referring to a folder by its actual name, even without the path, use ``inline literal``
