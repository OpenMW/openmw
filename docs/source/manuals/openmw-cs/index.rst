OpenMW CS User Manual
#####################

The following document is the complete user manual for *OpenMW CS*, the
construction set for the OpenMW game engine. It is intended to serve both as an
introduction and a reference for the application. Even if you are familiar with
modding *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind* you should at least read the first
few chapters to familiarise yourself with the new interface.

.. warning::
    OpenMW CS is still software in development. The manual does not cover any of
    its shortcomings, it is written as if everything was working as intended.
    Please report any software problems as bugs in the software, not errors in
    the manual.
