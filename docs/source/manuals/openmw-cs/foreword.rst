How to read the manual
**********************

The manual can be roughly divided into two parts: a tutorial part consisting of
the first two (three) chapters and the reference manual. We recommend all
readers to work through the tutorials first, there you will be guided through
the creation of a fairly simple mod where you can familiarise yourself with the
record-based interface. The tutorials are very simple and teach you only what
is necessary for the task, each one can be completed in under half an hour. It
is strongly recommended to do the tutorials in order.

When you are familiar with the CS in general and want to write your own mods it
is time to move on to the reference part of the manual. The reference chapters
can be read out of order, each one covers only one topic.
