OpenEngine README
=================

OpenEngine is a bunch of stand-alone game engine modules collected from the OpenMW project (see http://github.com/korslund/openmw or http://openmw.com ) and from certain other projects.

It is currently a very early work in progress, and development will follow OpenMW closely for a while forward.

OpenEngine will depend heavily on Mangle ( http://github.com/korslund/mangle/ ) and will thus aim to be backend agnostic. When finished it should work with a variety for free and commercial middleware libraries as backends for graphics, sound, physics, input and so on.

All questions can be directed to Nicolay Korslund at korslund@gmail.com
