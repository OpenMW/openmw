 * esps seem to contain copies of the STAT entries from the esms, and
 * the esms themselves contain several identical entries. Perhaps all
 * statics referenced in a file is also put in the file? Since we are
 * only reading files it doesn't much matter to us, but it would if we
 * were writing our own ESM/ESPs. You can check some files later when
 * you decode the CELL blocks, if you want to test this hypothesis.
