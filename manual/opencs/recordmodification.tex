So far you learned how to browse trough records stored inside the content files, but not how to modify them using the \OCS{} editor. Although browsing is certainly a usefull ability on it's own, You probabbly counted on doing actual editing with this editor. There are few ways user can alter records stored in the content files, each suited for certain class of a problem. In this section We will describe how to do change records using tables interface and edit panel.

\subsubsection{Glossary}
\begin{description}
  \item[Edit Panel] Interface element used inside the \OCS{} to present records data for editing. Unlike table it showes only one record at the time. However it also presents fields that are not visible inside the table. It is safe to say that Edit Panel presents data in way that is easier to read thanks to it's horizontal layout.
